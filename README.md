This work is a micro paper on feature selection with autoencoders and PCA. We used stacked autoencoders (SAE), variational autoencoders (VAE) and PCA. We worked with tensorflow and keras. This work has been done in collaboration with Romain REY, student at KTH and Data Scientist intern at Microsoft.
